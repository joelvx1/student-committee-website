        <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p class="body-text">
                My website is designed to be friendly and welcoming by using inviting colours
                like pink and purple. This is also a similar colour scheme to the University of Sheffield's purple.
                The main content of the website is placed in a rounded 'card-like' design to make the important 
                content stand out more. I have used an identifiable logo and title on every page to give the website some identity. I used a 
                mobile first responsive design by first designing my website to look on good on mobile-screen sizes.
                I then used breakpoints and flexboxes to rearrange elements when the screen was enlarged 
                (for larger desktop and laptop screens.)

            </figure>
            
            <p class="body-text">
                The sitemap for this website is very simple. From the main menu, every webpage can be accessed from either the
                navigation bar or the footer.

            <p class="body-text">
                This is the design layout I will aim to use in my webpage.
            </p>

        
        
        <h2>Design Reasoning</h2>
            <p class="body-text">
                I decided to just use one breakpoint for my website which
                acitvates when the screen width is over 900px. This is for the 'About Us' and 'Contact'
                pages. I chose the value 900px because this is the resolution of many tablets. Because
                the aspect ratio of desktop displays and tablets are similar, I found it was best to
                rearrange the elements on my website when the width was 900px, so the content would look
                better on tablets, and then scale the elements for bigger resolutions so the webpage would
                look good on large desktop displays. The flexboxes used on these pages would change to display content in a row instead of
                in a column so the extra screen space from having a larger desktop screen could be utilised.
                The 'Members' and 'Meetings' pages are mainly used for displaying lists
                so are very similar in design and do not have to be as responsive as the other pages that contain
                multiple images and forms.  
            </p>

        
        <h2>Menu System</h2>
            <p class="body-text">
                The menu system I will be using is a navigation bar that is placed below the header and above the main content.
                The navigation bar is responsive as it has a scrollbar effect so on smaller screens like mobile, you can simply swipe
                along the navigation bar to get to the other buttons. I chose this as it is a more visually appealing and less cluttered
                approach than simply putting them under each other. I also did not need to hide or get rid of any of the important menu
                buttons. The navigation bar also sticks to the top of the display, so no matter how far down the user is on the
                website, they can quickly change into the other menus without having to scroll back to the top.
            </p>
